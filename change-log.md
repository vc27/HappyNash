Todo
====================

1. Resizing pictures: could you give me a small tutorial? We can’t seem to make the sizing stick for uploads
3. There is a blog post titled “Things that make me move” and the picture displays sideways. I’ve tried reloading and rotating it, but it doesn’t change the display on the archive page. See URL: http://happynash.com/dev/category/happiness/
